<h1>Create a Repository</h1>

1) We'll start from your Github account. Navigate to your profile page, then click the tab labelled "Repositories" along the top. 

2) Click "New" in the upper right-hand corner.
    - Type a short, memorable name for your new repository (repo).
        - Add a description if you'd like
    - Create either a Public or a Private repository
        - Unless you're working on some NSA-level program, a public repository should be just fine.
    - Click the button to initialize the repo with README. 
        - README's are used to tell others how to run a program, or any pertinant information about it's creation. 
    - Now just simply click 'Create repository' and we're done with this step!

3) Now you should be able to see all the files available in the project. There should only be one - the README.md. The title of the project/repo will be displayed here, as well as the description if you gave it one.
    - On the right-hand side, click the button labeled 'Clone or download.' Click 'Clone with HTTPS,' then copy the URL displayed.
        - You may use SSH for added security, but additional set-up is required. Learn about this option <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use">here.</a>

4) Navigate to the Desktop application and follow any set-up instructions. We will clone the repo by going to the navigation bar at the top your computer's screen, clicking 'File' and then clicking 'Clone repository'.

5) Paste the URL from step 3 into the appropriate space, then select where you want to keep the file. Hit the 'Clone' button.
