<h1>Create a Repository</h1>

1) We'll start from your Github account. Navigate to your profile page, then click the tab labelled "Repositories" along the top. 

2) Click "New" in the upper right-hand corner.
    - Type a short, memorable name for your new repository (repo).
        - Add a description if you'd like
    - Create either a Public or a Private repository
        - Unless you're working on some NSA-level program, a public repository should be just fine.
    - Click the button to initialize the repo with README. 
        - README's are used to tell others how to run a program, or any pertinant information about it's creation. 
    - Now just simply click 'Create repository' and we're done with this step!

3) Now you should be able to see all the files available in the project. There should only be one - the README.md. The title of the project/repo will be displayed here, as well as the description if you gave it one.
    - On the right-hand side, click the button labeled 'Clone or download.' Click 'Clone with HTTPS,' then copy the URL displayed.
        - You may use SSH for added security, but additional set-up is required. Learn about this option <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use">here.</a>

4) Navigate to the Desktop application and follow any set-up instructions. We will clone the repo by going to the navigation bar at the top your computer's screen, clicking 'File' and then clicking 'Clone repository'.

5) Paste the URL from step 3 into the appropriate space, then select where you want to keep the file. Hit the 'Clone' button.
    - What we've just created is a local repository. This is exclusive to you, and no one can see any changes that you've made unless you push (aka upload) those files to the remote repository (what is stored on the Github website). Keep in mind, once you push code, everyone will be able to download and use that code in their own local repositories.

6) From here, you'll be able to see all the files you have added and any changes made to those files. If you every want to push those files, use the input box on the left hand side to write a short summary (this is required) and a description if you are so inclined. 
    - From there, click "Commit to Master."
    - You'll need to select "Push origin" if you want the files to actually appear in the remote repository.
    - Learn more about commits and pushing <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2745076/what-are-the-differences-between-git-commit-and-git-push">here</a>

7) If teammates make edits to the remote repository, you will be able to pull (retreive) those by either clicking on "Fetch origin" along the top of the application, or when a prompt appears in the center of your screen. 

8) There are many more things we can do with the Desktop app, including making branches, reviewing code, and fixing merge conflicts. Use <a href="https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects">this</a> resource to learn more about those options. This also covers some of the topics covered here, in case you are more of a visual learner.
