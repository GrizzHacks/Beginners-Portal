# Bank Account Tutorial
> Use this tutorial to learn some of the basics of Java

We'll be creating a way to generate different bank accounts under a fake bank for fictional people. Use this tutorial to learn about object-oriented programming and generate ideas for web applications.

## Set-Up

1. The best way (up for some debate) to develop Java applications is by using an IDE called NetBeans. [Please download NetBeans](https://netbeans.org) for this tutorial.
> I'll be using Netbeans v8.2. There are newer versions available, and all the code should follow.    
> You'll be fine if you download Java SE    
> You're more than welcome to see if your chosen text editor can write Java files, but Netbeans is generally the easiest system to work with.    
2. Upon opening NetBeans, click "File -> New Project". Leave the selections as "Java" and "Java Application". Save the project name as "BankAccounts" and save it to a location accessable by your Github connection, DevPost, etc... Finally, click "Finish".
3. When the file first opens, you'll see a whole bunch of confusing text. Under the gray text that reads `// TODO code application logic here`, write `System.out.println("Hello World!")`.
> Make sure this new line is in between the curly braces (`{}`).
4. Press the green play arrow at the top of the page, and see what happens! You should now see "Hello World!" printed in the built-in terminal. Pretty cool, right? We'll be doing some more awesome stuff later on.

If you want to see you file in context, you can click on the "Projects" tab along the left side of the screen. Feel free to explore more of the IDE before getting started.
