## Set-Up

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are easy to work with and involve little advanced set-up. 

1) Open a new file in your text editor. Save it to a location where you can find it later by clicking 'File -> Save,' renaming the file as 'index.html', and changing the save location to the file where your Github Repository is located, or your Desktop, or etc... 
2) Repeat this process with a second file, but save it as 'style.css'.
