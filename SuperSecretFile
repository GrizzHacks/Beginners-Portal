Ideas and Project Walkthroughs for New Hackers

Potential Ideas - To be expanded upon:

Text-based adventure game. Write basic tutorial, then suggest programers up PyGames to animate the game, or build it out another way (VR? Unity? etc...)

Small Unity-based 2D/3D game. Basic tutorial, then suggest turning it into an app, building more levels, etc...

School-based application: Make a task-manager (planner), alert system for the least and most busiest times in the OC/Vandy/Hillcrest, parking app, etc... Could probably do a tutorial for a task manager, suggest other options (chat program)

Website. Front-end design tutorial, introduce Django/React

Raspberry PI's and Arduino tutorials
