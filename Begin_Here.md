<h1>New Programmers should start with the following steps:</h1>
 
1) Make sure you have a text/source-code editor installed. Examples are Atom, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Netbeans.
    - For most tutorials here, Visula Studio Code will be used. 

2) If you are using a Mac, install Homebrew. This is a package-management software that you can install in your terminal, and will 
help you quickly and easily download any packages you may need, like npm, Python, or Ruby.

3) GrizzHacks will be using Devpost to judge all projects. Devpost has Github integration, so we recommend you have a Github account. 
This will make it easier to share your project among multiple members, integrate version control, and many employers will ask you
to link to your Github account when applying for a position. 

4) Look up how to set up a repository, as well as different command-line prompts. We've created a small tutorial here: XXX;

5) Decide what you want your project to be, and program it! That's it!
