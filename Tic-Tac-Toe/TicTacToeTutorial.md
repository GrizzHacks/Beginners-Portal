We're going to playing Tic-Tac-Toe in our Terminal! While simple, this tutorial can serve as a launch point for more complex games or other projects.

##Set-Up

1. You'll need to start by downloading Python 3.7.X from [Python.org](https://www.python.org) Python can be downloaded for Windows, Linux, Mac, and other OS's. 
*NOTE*: This tutorial will take place on a Mac, so you may need to look up terminal commands for your own operating system.

2. After you've downloaded Python, we'll be able to run it from the terminal by typing `python3.7`. This opens up what is known as the python shell, and allows us to check our code and different commands right in the terminal. 

    Go ahead and type `print("Hello World")` into the terminal. Congrats! You've just returned what we call a string. Strings are denoted by `''` or `"",` and are collections of alphanumeric characters. [Learn more about strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)

    We'll exit out of the shell by typing `quit()`, but if you'd like to keep exploring, [this website](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_interactive.php) gives a nice overview of what you can do.

3. Go ahead and open up a new file in your text editor. We'll name this file 'TicTacToe.py.' Be sure to save it to a location where you can find it later. Or save it so that you can share it to Github. 

    You may be wondering: Are there any tools to help me program Python? There are! If you're using VS Code, feel free to look up python extensions and install any that you feel will be beneficial.
